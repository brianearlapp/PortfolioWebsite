Note to reader
- Intended as a very rudimentary 'roadmap' to help guide and focus my work. Ultimately falls short of a real roadmap in many ways

Landing/Home Page: absolute minimum
- Node.js server is running and reachable
- really basic content
	- Title 
	- no CSS yet
	- no links to other pages
- first draft of UI design
- Design content delivery (e.g. template strategy, what is static) but don't implement anything
	- Update this roadmap accordingly

Sample projects page
- basic plumbing for the router
- create projects page 
- link from the home page
- Title that links back to home page (not marked as a link)
- Design home page
	- Update roadmap accordingly
	
Update Home page
- implement the main title bar including navigation
- TBD based on design work down in the previous deliverable

TicTacToe Page
- Create TicTacToe page
	- Just a title that links back to home page
- link from the home page
- update router
- Future design work based on features in roadmap
	- design TicTacToe page
	- design tictactoe architecture

Basic TicTacToe game
- implement the same feature set as the original project but client/server and using the updated 

Potential additional features (not in 'roadmap' yet)
- TTT play against another person (random person)
	- play against a friend (select person)
	- play against the computer (possible normal and easy difficulty)
	- chat with other player
- Resume
	- Display hard coded content (basic)
	- Admin to add new content (requiring Admin log in)

********* Finished Work *********

Project start (create repositories)
- create GitHub and local repositories for this project
- 'link' those repositories together
- push existing materials to the GitHub repository (likely just this roadmap)
- add project to GitHub
	- create GitHub and local repositories for old tic tac toe project
	- 'link' those two repositories together
	- push materials to the github repository
